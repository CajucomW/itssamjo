- (Finally) Ready to tackle authentication. Still having a hell of a time deploying to Heroku. I was messing w/ gunicorn stuff, which was all way over my head.

- That took a While. I restructured the code to have 
the Django Project have a React App for it's frontend.
After a ton of trial and error, I was able to connect 
the two ends along w/ basic C.R.D. operations.


### TODO:

- Login/Authentication
- Make Heroku-ready > deploy to heroku
- Styling
- Write Update operation
