- Unable to migrate files because of the new fields I've added. Easy fix would probably be to nuke the existing db and start fresh w/ the most recent table.

- (Finally) Ready to tackle authentication. Still having a hell of a time deploying to Heroku. I was messing w/ gunicorn stuff, which was all way over my head.


### TODO:

- Login/Authentication
- Make Heroku-ready > deploy to heroku
- Styling
- Write Update operation
