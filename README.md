Personal blog page in the works.

### Build

- Django Backend
- React as Django App
- REST Framework

### Progress...

06282020
- Fixed migration bug by deleting duplicated titles
- Moving on to Login/Authentication using tokens

06262020
- Unable to migrate files because of the new fields I've added. Easy fix would probably be to nuke the existing db and start fresh w/ the most recent table.

### TODO:

- Login/Authentication
- Make Heroku-ready > deploy to heroku
- Styling
- Write Update operation
